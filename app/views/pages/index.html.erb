<h2>
  The pain with multiple workstations
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
  Sure you love

  the most advanced DICOM Viewer on earth.
  But setting up a new OsiriX workstation takes time: you manually have to
  type in your whole DICOM nodelist in order to transfer studies between your
  1st, 2nd,... and n-th PACS, the fancy disk robot, a few offsite
  locations and some other departments.
  And at the slighest nodelist change you're touching every workstation again.
  That's just boring repetitive work even a trained monkey could do.
  Save your valuable time for important stuff!

<h2>
  An overlooked feature of OsiriX
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
  What if you could manage only <em>one</em> nodelist and automagically keep
  all workstations up-to-date?
  Well, actually you can.
  OsiriX has this great feature to load a nodelist from a remote URL.
  There is only one downside:
  Self-hosting and updating such remote nodelist is a big project itself and
  quite the opposite of user-friendly (trust us, we've been there).
  No wonder that most people still manage their nodelists manually.
  Isn't there a simple way? Yes.
</p>
  
<h2>
  Keep it simpler
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
  <em>OsiriX Nodes</em> lets you manage your DICOM nodelist online with your
  browser, and makes it accessible to your workstations over a private and
  secure URL.
  <% if User.left_beta_accounts > 0 %>
    Just <%= link_to 'sign up for free', new_user_registration_url %>,
  <% else %>
    Just sign up for free (new BETA seats will be available soon),
  <% end %>
  add your nodes and update your workstations to use the new URL.
  Done.
  Workstations will pick up nodelist updates instantly on each OsiriX restart.

<h2>
  Secure is secure is secure
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
  We care about your data as much as you do, even though a nodelist contains no
  sensitive data.
  All connections are forced over SSL-encrypted tunnels.
  And your worklist can only be downloaded over a private URL,
  protected by a unique and strong 128-bit key.
  (Some might say this is paranoid.)
