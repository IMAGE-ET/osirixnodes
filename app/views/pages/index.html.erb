  The pain with multiple workstations
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
  Sure, you love
  <%= link_to 'OsiriX', 'http://www.osirix-viewer.com',
    title: 'The most advanced DICOM Viewer / Workstation on earth' %>,
  the most advanced DICOM Viewer on earth.
  But setting up a new workstation with OsiriX takes time: you have to manually
  type in your whole DICOM nodelist in order to fetch studies (your 1st, 2nd,
  3rd... and 18th PACS, one or two disk robots, some offsite locations, other
  departments, etc.).
  And at the slighest nodelist change you'll end up touching every workstation
  again.

  That is just boring manual work for trained monkeys.
  That's not for you, right?

<h2>
  An overlocked feature of OsiriX
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
  What if you could manage only <em>one</em> nodelist and automagically keep
  all workstations up-to-date?
  Well, actually you can.
  OsiriX has this great feature to load a nodelist from a remote URL.
  But hosting and updating such remote server is a task on itself and quite the
  opposite of user-friendly (trust me, I've been there).
  Isn't there a better way?
</p>
  
<h2>
  A simple fix
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
  <em>OsiriX Nodes</em> lets you manage your DICOM nodelist online, so that
  your workstations can download this nodelist over a private and secure URL.
  Just <%= link_to 'sign up for free', new_user_registration_url %>, add your
  nodes and update your workstations to use the new URL.
  Done.
  All your workstations will updated themselfs on each OsiriX restart.
</p>

<h2>
  Secure is secure is secure
</h2>
<p class='lead'>
  OsiriX Nodes cares about your data as much as you do, even though a nodelist
  contains no sensitive data.
  All connections are forced over SSL-encrypted tunnels.
  And your worklist can only be downloaded over a private URL which is itself
  protected by a unique 128-bit key.
  (Some might say this is paranoid.)
